# Splatoon 3 - Salmon Run Next Wave

#### Background

Splatoon 3 is an action 3rd-person shooter game where playable characters are human-like squids/octopus. The game revolves around using weapons to shoot ink to claim objectives or meet quotas. The main game mode I play is called Salmon Run, which is a player vs. environment mode. Players must obtain and deposit golden eggs from zombie-like creatures called salmonids, and meet the demanding quotas within the time limit.

I have reached the highest rank of Eggsecutive (EVP) 999 during many weapon rotations and maps. I have also participated in Big Run events and score within the top 1% of players. These achivements are listed below:
